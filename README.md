# Post Mortem
Did not finish because of outside time constraints. The idea was to have a left-to-right scrolling roguelike where different attacks are forced upon you by the blocks that you break.
Might not be the most roguelike-y idea but it does kinda work. Most of the core game loop was implemented. It is missing more content and polish.
